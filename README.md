# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Study Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) study repository! This repository is a collection of resources, code implementations, and practice problems to help me master DSA concepts and prepare for technical interviews.

## **About**
This repository is my personal study guide for learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms. It includes:
- Code implementations of common data structures and algorithms.
- Solutions to popular DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode.
- Notes and explanations to reinforce my understanding.

## **Topics Covered**
Here are the key topics I plan to cover:

### **Data Structures**
- Arrays -- i`m here now
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Tries, Heaps)
- Graphs
- Advanced Structures (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, etc.)

### **Algorithms**
- Sorting and Searching (QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- Bit Manipulation
